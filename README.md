# [Project 1) Carvana Cars Regression Project:](https://github.com/elayer/CarvanaCarsProject)
* Created a model base to help those considering selling or trading in their car to Carvana get an idea of what price they can expect.

* Scraped roughly two thousand pages of car data from Carvana's used car listings using a custom-built web scraper. 

* Cleaned and processed the data for preparation for EDA and model building tasks. Tasks ranged from imputing missing values to feature engineering new versions of variables which had high cardinality. I also performed some outlier detections techniques using PyCaret as well as Z-score.

* Within Model Building, I began by dropping insignificant attributes as well as variables exhibiting multicollinearity. After using the OLS method from statsmodels, I moved into applying linear regression techniques such as standard Linear Regression, Elastic Net, and Kernel Ridge. I followed this up by applying more powerful models such as Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost regression.
